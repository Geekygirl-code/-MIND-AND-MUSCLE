Drinking water is the initial and the most prominent aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Primary functions of drinking water include transportation of nutrients throughout the body, regulating the body temperature as well as maintaining the pH levels so as to ensure the body's well being and its prevention against certain risks and diseases, especially kidney stones.

Drinking water not only helps the body in relieving toxins but also acts as an appetite suppressant. Having a glass or two before meals can make one feel full for a longer amount of time, thereby reducing the calorie intake.
