The Atkins diet is a low-carb diet, usually recommended for weight loss.

Proponents of this diet claim that you can lose weight while eating as much protein and fat as one wants as long as they avoid foods high in carbohydrates.
In the past 12 years, more than 20 studies have shown that low-carb diets without calorie counting are highly effective for weight loss and can lead to varied health improvements. It was originally promoted by the physician Dr. Robert C. Atkins, wrote a best-selling book about it in 1972.

Since then, the Atkins diet has been popular all over the world.

Despite being high in fat, it does not raise “bad” LDL cholesterol on average, though it does happen to some individuals.

The main reason why low-carb diets are so effective for weight loss is that a reduction in carbohydrates  and increased protein intake lead to a reduced appetite, making one consume lesser calories.

 
FOUR PHASE PLAN

Phase 1 (induction): The consumption in this phase is only 20 grams of carbs per day for 2 weeks. Eating high-fat, high-protein, with low carb vegetables like leafy greens kick-starts the weight loss process.

Phase 2 (balancing): It includes gradually adding more nuts, low-carb vegetables and small amounts of fruit back to the diet.

Phase 3 (fine-tuning): After coming close to your set goal weight, adding more carbs to the diet is prescribed until weight loss slows down.

Phase 4 (maintenance): In this phase one can consume as many healthy carbs as the body can tolerate without regaining weight.
 
FOODS TO AVOID

The following foods should be avoided on the Atkins diet:

Sugar: Aerated drinks, fruit juices, cakes, candies, ice cream, etc.
Grains: Wheat, spelt, rye, barley, rice.
Vegetable oils: Soybean oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil and few others.
Trans fats: Found in processed foods with the word "hydrogenated" on the ingredients list.
"Diet" and "low-fat" foods: These are usually very high in sugar content.
High-carb vegetables: Carrots, turnips, etc (induction only).
High-carb fruits: Bananas, apples, oranges, grapes, pears (induction only).
Starches: Potatoes, sweet potatoes (induction only).
Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, beans, etc. (induction only).
 
FOODS TO EAT

Meats: Beef, pork, lamb, chicken, bacon and others.
Fatty fish and seafood: Salmon, trout, sardines, etc.
Eggs: The healthiest eggs are omega-3 enriched or pastured.
Low-carb vegetables: Kale, spinach, broccoli, asparagus and others.
Full-fat dairy: Butter, cheese, cream, full-fat yogurt.
Nuts and seeds: Almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds, etc.
Healthy fats: Extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, avocados and avocado oil.

As long as the diet is based around a fatty sources of protein with vegetables or nuts and some healthy fats, weight loss will be effective.
