Building lean muscles whilst burning fats may not seem as straightforward, but a few calculations and trips to the supermarket can direct you to your way to a new physique.

Energy expenditure and your diet are the key aspects. The aim is to consume around 2-3 gm of protein per kilogram of lean bodyweight every day, whilst reducing your carbohydrate (energy) intake to help the body manage the nutrients consumed.

This sample diet plan has been constructed to demonstrate how to plan one's own lean muscle diet, according to individual calculations and dietary needs. The meal plan ensures your consumption of sufficient high-quality muscle-building protein whilst also fuelling the body with the essential heart-healthy fats, vitamins and minerals.
