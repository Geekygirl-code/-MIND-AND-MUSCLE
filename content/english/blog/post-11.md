Indulge intro foods containing natural sugars like naturally sweet vegetables such as carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, onions, yams, bell peppers and squash. These foods not only add sweetness to the meal but also help in reducing cravings for added sugar.

These can be added to soups, stews and pasta sauces for a satisfying sweet kick. The aim of indulging in these items is not completely restrict the intake of sugary foods, but to limit them occasionally in order to achieve one's health and fitness goals.
