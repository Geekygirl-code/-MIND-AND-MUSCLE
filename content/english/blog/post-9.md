It is highly important to be aware of what ingredients in what quantities go into the food you buy and consume. High amounts of sugar and unhealthy fats are often hided in packaged food, whilst their tagline may say otherwise.

Once you develop this habit and get aware of what exactly you are putting in your body, your mind and conscience will automatically not allow you to indulge in these products, acting as a strong source of motivation.
