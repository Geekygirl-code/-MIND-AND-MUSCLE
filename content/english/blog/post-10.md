Our body finds it difficult to process carbohydrates late in evening. The organs tend to work faster than their normal speed at night and utilise the entire days's consumption to do so because of which we wake up hungry and need a good breakfast to boost our energy levels.

Keeping it light at night gives puts less pressure on our digestive system and intestinal functions. Since we do not engage in physical work after dinner and tend to rest and sleep, the utilisation of energy provided the food is zero as a result of which it starts transforming into fat.
