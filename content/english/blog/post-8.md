It is actually way simpler than the title suggests. All the food items that are consumed by us in a day are essentially just calories for the body. They are further broken down by our systems to produce energy, leading the excessive calories to get stored in form of fat.

Counting calories can greatly help in creating a deficit which helps in burning the body fat faster.

A calorie deficit pattern of consuming foods is essentially based on the concept that as long as one consumes fewer calories than they burn, they are bound to lose weight. The pattern requires the individual to simply count the number of calories their body needs in order to function smoothly without feeling hungry and deprived, and how much deficit they need to create without proposing any harm to their health.

The deficit can easily be created without proposing any harm to health by cutting down calories and unhealthy fats. Different body types need different amounts of calorie counts to be consumed in a day. This can easily be calculated with the help of an online calculator or by consulting a dietician.
