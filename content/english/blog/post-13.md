🌿 **The Vegan Diet Plan**  
*A wholesome guide to plant-based eating*

A vegan diet eliminates all animal products — meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and even honey. People choose veganism for ethical, environmental, or health reasons. Plant-based diets reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve natural resources, and may even prevent chronic illnesses.

Over time, vegan diets have shown benefits like improved heart health, weight loss, and better blood sugar control.

🥗 **The Vegan Way**  
A balanced vegan diet should include whole grains, plant proteins, healthy fats, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Include foods like:

- 🌰 Nuts, seeds, legumes, and soy products  
- 🧂 Nutritional yeast for protein & B12  
- 🥑 Avocado, coconut, and olive oils for healthy fats
